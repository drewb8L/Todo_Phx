# Todo list

Clone repo and cd into the directory.

Start the Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Once you have confirmed that the Phoenix server is up and running, in a new terminal window or tab navigate to the React application directory, `$ cd todo_phx/todo_react/`

Run `npm install` and then run `npm start`.

Navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000) and enter a task into the text bar.
Once a task has been added you can edit the task name, mark the task as complete, reset a completed task as incomplete and lastly delete a task.
